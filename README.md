# Data for the paper Determinants of Word Duration in Ten Language Documentation Corpora
This repository contains R scripts and analysis protocols for the paper "Determinants of phonetic word duration in ten language documentation corpora" by Jan Strunk, Frank Seifart, Swintha Danielsen, Iren Hartmann, Brigitte Pakendorf, SÃ¸ren Wichmann, Alena Witzlack-Makarevich, and Balthasar Bickel.

This repository contains the following three files:

data_preparation.r_functions.R    A collection of R functions for further annotating language documentation corpora in R and for preparing them for analysis (saved as a text file in UTF-8 format, which can be read into R using source("data_preparation.r_functions.R"))

data_preparation.txt              A text file containing a protocol of how the language documentation data was read into R using Taras Zakharko's R library ToolboxSearch: https://bitbucket.org/tzakharko/toolboxsearch and then further annotated and prepared for analysis using the functions contained in data_preparation.r_functions.R.

analysis.rmd                      A KnitR workbook (https://yihui.org/knitr/) which contains the R code for the statistical analyses carried out for the paper.

Additional Python scripts used to prepare Toolbox files for import into R can be found in the GitHub repository:
